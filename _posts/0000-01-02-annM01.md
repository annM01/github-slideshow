As Charles Dickens said in *A Tale of Two Cities*:

>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, 
>it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, 
>it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, 
>it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, 
>it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.
